# Neural Image Caption Generator

TODO: Tidy up and add code

This repository contains the code to generate image captions using deep neural networks in TensorFlow 2.0

The code was used to generate the content/examples shown in my following posts:

1. [Neural Image Caption - Part 1](https://www.katnoria.com/nic-p1/)
2. [Visualising Decoding Algorithms](https://www.katnoria.com/nlg-decoders/)
3. [Effect of Parameters on Beam Search](https://https://www.katnoria.com/nlg-beamsearch/)
